# InstagramChat

If you need all your instagram data, then there is an option to get all the data. You have to request for the data in the app. After 2-3 days, all the data is provided by instagram. It contains all the saved posts, chats, etc. All the chats are given in json format. As the chats can be very length, the json file is very complex to read. Hence, this python script can be used to easily get the chats in the format available in instagram i.e. The user's chat on right side and other person's chat on left side. It takes each chat from the json file, bifurcates it in *GroupChat* or *DM* and then creates a folder containing textfiles of chats with each person.
